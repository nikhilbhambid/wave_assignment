I have completed both the given task and this is summary of the assignment

-->before testing code add proper values in .enviornment file. It contains AWS access,secret,region and bucket values
-->requirement.txt contains all the necessary lib needed to be download while running code in docker container
-->install_requirements.sh needed to run while running on local pc for the same operation.
--> Dockerfile contains code to create image.
--> main.py contains main code for task.


Task1:
Python 3.8+ needd to be download in local machine.
Download all dependencies with install_requirements.sh
Before running install_requirements.sh permission command needed. run following code in bash script
-->chmod +x install_requirements.sh
Then run install_requirements.sh with following code
--> ./install_requirements.sh
Now that we have all the requirements we can run main.py
--> python main.py --city=Toronto --year==2018
code dynamically works for following cities in canada. and needed to be add exact same input to get result.
    "Victoria",
    "Vancouver",
    "Edmonton",
    "Calgary",
    "Regina",
    "Saskatoon",
    "Winnipeg",
    "Ottawa",
    "Toronto",
    "Quebec",
    "Quebec/Jean Lesage",
    "Montreal/Pierre Elliott Trudeau",
    "Montreal",
    "Montreal Mirabel",
    "Fredericton",
    "Moncton/Greater Moncton Romeo Leblanc",
    "Moncton / Greater Moncton Romeo Leblanc",
    "Gander",
    "St. John's"
Although i found some things while working on assignment that weather data needed station ID to fetch data. so i am collecting from 
Station Inventory. Apart from that i did not find any relevacy of inventory so i did not joined 2 tables.
Other things i have completed as per asked. code will generate excel file with each years data in different tab and will save
in wave/ folder.
After cleaning of data i am uploading data in S3 with partition to the day level in parquet format.
Reading same data for further analytical questions. and solving those queries in pandas.

Task2:
Docker takes care of requirements and just needed to run 2 commands which will build and run container.
same code i am running in container and also storing excel file in wave/ volume.

run following commands on bash to run docker container
--> docker build -t wave_assignment  --build-arg cityname=Toronto --build-arg yearvalue=2018 .
here you can change inputs for city and year.
--> docker run -it -v wave:/wave wave_assignment


Thank You for this opportunity. It was fun to solve this assignment. looking forward to hear back from you.
